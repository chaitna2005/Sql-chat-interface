| PostgreSQL live schema reader            | Working      |
| Markdown tables in Gradio chat           | Clean & neat |
| Token logging to file (`token_log.txt`)  | Accurate     |
| Modular code (split into files)          | Organized    |
| Multi-database support (.env-based)      | âœ… Implemented|

## ðŸ”„ Latest Additions: PostgreSQL Support & Improved Flexibility

- **PostgreSQL Integration**  
  The system now supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL. Just switch the `DB_TYPE` value in the `.env` file (`mysql` or `postgres`) and the app will connect accordingly.

- **Dynamic Schema Description**  
  Schema is read live from either MySQL or PostgreSQL and used to generate more accurate SQL queries based on the actual structure.

- **Database-Agnostic Query Execution**  
  All query execution logic now handles both PostgreSQL and MySQL backends using shared code paths with proper drivers (`psycopg2` and `mysql-connector-python`).

- **Improved Connection Management**  
  The app now connects through `password_db.py`, ensuring centralized and reusable logic for database access.

## ðŸ”’ Recent Improvements: Enhanced User Authentication & UI

- **Secure Password Hashing**  
  Passwords are now securely hashed before storing in the database, protecting user credentials from exposure.

- **Improved Login Flow**  
  Users are automatically redirected to the chat interface upon successful login for a smoother experience.

- **Logout Feature Added**  
  A logout button has been integrated within the chat UI to allow users to safely sign out.

- **Frontend & Backend Integration**  
  Signup, login, password change, and logout functionalities are fully connected between frontend (Gradio) and backend.  
  Clear success and error messages provide immediate user feedback.

- **Dynamic UI Based on User Status**  
  The interface dynamically updates visible elements depending on whether the user is logged in, improving usability and clarity.

- **Chat AI System Fully Maintained**  
  The core functionality where natural language queries are converted into SQL and executed remains fully intact and operational.
